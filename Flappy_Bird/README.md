# Flappy Bird Phaser

This app was made with Phaser.

The bird travels across the screen with "space" or "^".

If the bird collides with the road or columns the game is over.

Try to travel to the end of the screen to without hitting anything to win the game.

## TODO

- Infinitely generate columns that move towards the bird instead of the bird moving right.

- Randomize colummn height to make game harder

- Add a score counter that increment up 1 when the columns moves off the screen.

- Display score when game is over

- Display button to restart game when game is over
